# hello-world
Welcome to a repository that I sort of made.
I wish that just about everything that is done is easily explainable.
Why i'm here trying to code is not one of these situations.
There really isn't really a direction that I wish to take.
If I feel there is a purpose to keep learning; I will.
As for now, I'll work on learning and exploring.
